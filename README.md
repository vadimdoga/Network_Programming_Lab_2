## Getting Started

Implementing own protocol based on UDP.

### Mandatory Tasks

```
1. Implement a protocol atop UDP
- With a method to make it more reliable, using either (1) error checking + retransmission (this is simple) or (2) error correction (a bit harder but cooler)
- Make the connection secure, using either symmetric streaming or asymmetric encryption

2. Then, once your protocol is more reliable and secure, make an application-level protocol on top of it, like FTP, or HTTP:
- A set of methods/verbs and rules on how to interact with it
- Model the protocol as a state machine, for documentation

3.To prove that everything is working as intended, make a server and a client using this nice protocol of yours.
